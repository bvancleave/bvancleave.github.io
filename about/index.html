  <p>It is rare in life to be granted a second chance, and it is almost unheard of to be given a third chance.  When I went to 
  Southern Illinois University for a degree in Physics as a freshman, I was not prepared mentally for the responsibility of 
  being on my own.  I had to re-assess my life, and I became the student everyone expected for me to be when I attended Prairie
  State College.  I thought I matured mentally, but I failed again; the challenges of being on my own overwhelmed me.   I felt I
  had my opportunities slip away.</p>
  
  <p>We all have special talents, and I was always good with computers.  I learned to program at a young age, but I never took my
  hobby seriously.  Out of the blue, I had an opportunity of a lifetime.  A friend of mine from California offered me a job in
  Menlo Park.  This opportunity changed my life.  I had a new goal, new responsibilities, and new challenges to overcome.  About
  a year later I joined an internet startup company called Petjungle.com.  Petjungle.com was under the umbrella of 
  Idealab! - an internet incubator famous for funding many of the popular startups during that time.  I made the transition from
  being a developer to a software engineer specializing in Java and PL/SQL.  I was surrounded by brilliant co-workers, and they 
  helped me mature as an engineer and as a person.  NetDynamics put me on the path of working in the Computer Industry, but it was
	  working at Petjungle.com/PetSmart.com where I knew this path was right for me.</p>
  
  <p>I was accustomed to fluctuations in the marketplace, and company downsizing is tough on everyone.  I had friends that were 
  subjected to downsizing, but I never thought it could happen to me.  It was January 4th, 2009, when my manager told me the news.
  He asked me, “How can you be so calm?”  I simply replied, “It’s a business.”  My old self would have been outraged at being laid
  off, but I took it as a blessing, a new directional change.  I always wanted to go back to school to finish with a four-year
  degree, and I saw this as a great opportunity to do so.  I applied to Purdue Calumet and moved back to the Chicagoland area.</p>
  
  <p>Achieving my Bachelors in Computer Science was only the first step.   When I started this journey, I made a pledge to myself that
  I would accept nothing less than an A.  I sacrificed a lot to come back to school, so I had to be fully committed.  I always
  acted in a professional manner and having over ten years work experience gave me a unique perspective.</p>
