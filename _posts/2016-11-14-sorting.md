## Introduction
As a computer science major, one learns that data structures and algorithms are building blocks of programs; and one learns various sorting algorithms, insertion, merge, and quicksort to name a few, 
early in their curriculum.  Sorting is important in computer programming, and as a programmer, you will encounter problems that you will have to solve using sorting algorithms.

A few years ago as a student, we had a discussion about sorting in our programming languages class.  We wanted to construct a generic sorting algorithm in Java similar to our Scheme implementation and make a comparison, if possible.  For our example, we used Scheme and Java to sort the names, areas and population of certain countries.

## Scheme

Scheme is a functional language, and if you are interested in the language, then you can [download it here](https://www.gnu.org/software/mit-scheme/).

Let's take a look at the data structure.  The variable countries is a list of 3-tuple elements : name, area, and population.

``` scheme
(define countries
   '(("Uruguay"  176220   3.4)
     ("Thailand" 513000    67)
     ("Belgium"   30528    11)
     ("Zaire"   2345410  46.5) 
     ("Belize"    22966  0.334)))
```

And, here is our sorting algorithm.  The formal parameters of mySort is a list and a function.  

*Did you just say a function is a parameter?  Yep.*

Let's take a moment to talk about first-class functions.  What is a [first-class function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-class_function)?  This is a function that can be passed as a parameter, assigned to a variable, and returned from a function.  First-class functions are needed in Functional Programming.  The sorting algorithm in Scheme listed below is an example of a [higher-order function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher-order_function).  Higher-order functions have at least one function as a parameter or return a function as the result.

*Wait a minute?  I thought we were talking about sorting?*

*We are, but I will show how to implement this example in Java 8 using the functional aspect the language has to offer.*
  
Note: the lambda keyword represents the start of a lambda expression, and the syntax is lambda (parameters) (body).  When we get to the Java 8 section, you will see how Java implements their lambda 
expressions.  Again, this is not a discussion about functional languages, so I am not going to explain all of the Scheme code.  But, just for a moment, look at the implementation and the lines of code.

``` scheme
(define mySort
  (lambda (lst cmp)  ; cmp is a function parameter
    (letrec
        ((insert
          (lambda (x lst)  ; nested function
            (cond
              ((null? lst) (cons x '()))
              ((cmp x (car lst)) (cons x lst)) ; cmp is a non-local reference
              (else                            ; that is lexically scoped
               (cons (car lst) (insert x (cdr lst)))))))
         (sort
          (lambda (lst)                ; another nested function
            (cond ((null? lst) '())
            (else (insert (car lst) (sort (cdr lst))))))))
      (sort lst))))
```

We constructed our higher-order function, so now let's focus on the comparators; that is, the function we will pass as a parameter to mySort.  You may seem confused why we have a function parameter.
In Scheme, < and > are comparison functions.  This is one of the many differences with Java. So, by definition, our comparators are higher-order functions as well.  The importance of this code is that
we do not need to rewrite our algorithm to change the behavior - in this case, the comparison.  We simply pass a new comparator function, and we promote code reuse.

``` scheme
(define makeCmpByArea
  (lambda (fn)                              ; fn is a function parameter
    (lambda (c1 c2)                         ; makeCmpByArea has a function return value
      (fn (car (cdr c1)) (car (cdr c2)))))) ; fn is a non-local reference

(define makeCmpByPopulation
  (lambda (fn)                       ; fn is a function parameter
    (lambda (c1 c2)                  ; a function return value
       (fn (caddr c1) (caddr c2))))) ; fn is a non-local reference

```

Finally, we are able to execute our sorting implementation.

``` scheme
(mySort countries (makeCmpByArea <))
(mySort countries (makeCmpByArea >))
(mySort countries (makeCmpByPopulation <))
(mySort countries (makeCmpByPopulation >))
```

## Styles
Note: In our class discussion, we were not speaking about Java 8.  As an exercise for myself, I re-wrote the example to use Java 8 after class.

Our goal is to construct our sorting implementation to be generic, so we will first look at how sorting is done in Java.  We will use the sort method provided by Java just as we did with our Scheme example.
In our Scheme example, we created the mySort function.  This function allowed us to be very flexible how we sort our data.  But, in Java, we do not have to worry about constructing mySort because of Collections.sort() method.  Our focus will be on the Comparator class.

As with our Scheme solution, let's start with our data structure.

``` java
List<Country> countries = Arrays.asList(
    	 new Country("Uruguay",   176220,   3.4),
         new Country("Thailand",  514000,  67.0),
         new Country("Belgium",    30528,  11.0),
         new Country("Zaire",    2345410,  46.5),
         new Country("Belize",     22966,   0.334));
```
The List has a type parameter of County, and unlike in our Scheme example, we have to construct the Country class.  Nothing scary here.  Just a simple data class.

``` java
/**
   A country with a name, area, and population.
*/
class Country
{
   private String name;
   private double area;
   private double population;

   /**
      Constructs a country.
      @param name the name of the country
      @param area the area of the country
      @param population  the population of the country
   */
   public Country(String name, double area, double population)
   {
      this.name = name;
      this.area = area;
      this.population = population;
   }

   /**
      Gets the name of the country.
      @return the name
   */
   public String getName()
   {
      return this.name;
   }

   /**
      Gets the area of the country.
      @return the area
   */
   public double getArea()
   {
      return this.area;
   }

   /**
      Gets the population of the country.
      @return the area
   */
   public double getPopulation()
   {
      return this.population;
   }

   public String toString()
   {
      return name + ": area = " + area + ", population = " + population;
   }
}
```

### Public Classes

With our first solution, we create a standalone public class that implements [Comparator](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Comparator.html) with type parameter Country.  To construct
our class, we need to override the compare method.  Since we are implementing our comparator to sort in ascending order, we create the following:

``` java
import java.util.*;

public class CountryComparatorByArea_a implements Comparator<Country> {
   public int compare(Country country1, Country country2) {
      /* Another way would be to use Integer.compareTo() method */
      if (country1.getArea() < country2.getArea() ) return -1;
      if (country1.getArea() > country2.getArea() ) return  1;
      return 0;
   }
}
```

Note: the Population Comparator is similar to the code above.

When we construct our Name Comparator, we use the [compareTo](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/String.html#compareTo(java.lang.String)) method of the [String](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/String.html) class.

Java doesn't have the ability to treat < and > as functions, so we need to create separate methods or add additional logic for ascending and descending.

``` java
import java.util.*;

public class CountryComparatorByName_a implements Comparator<Country> {
   public int compare(Country country1, Country country2) {
      return country1.getName().compareTo(country2.getName());
   }
}
```

And, in the main method of ComparatorTester.java, we instantiate the classes, CountryComparatorByArea_a and CountryComparatorByName_a.  Compare this statement with our Scheme 
execution : [function/method] ( list, function/method ).  For our Java implementation, we are using 
[Collections.sort](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Collections.html#sort(java.util.List,%20java.util.Comparator)) to handle the sorting for us.    

``` java
Comparator<Country> comp1 = new CountryComparatorByName_a();
Comparator<Country> comp2 = new CountryComparatorByArea_a();

// Call the sort() method and pass "comp2" comparator object.
Collections.sort(countries, comp2);

// Now the List is sorted by area, ascending.

// Call the sort() method and pass "comp1" comparator object.
Collections.sort(countries, comp1);

// Now the List is sorted by name, ascending.
```

To save creating additional methods for descending order, we could use [Collections.reverseOrder()](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Collections.html#reverseOrder(java.util.Comparator))
method.

``` java
// Call sort, and the List should be sorted in descending order
Collections.sort( countries, Collections.reverseOrder( comp2 ) );
```

### Private Classes
This style is similar to the first.  Instead of making our Comparator class public, we include it in our Driver (Test) class.  

``` java
public class ComparatorTester {}

class CountryComparatorByName_a {}
```

Note: we could have used anonymous comparator objects; that is, we didn't have to name them as we did in the Public Class case.  For example,

``` java
Collections.sort( countries, new CountryComparatorByName_a() );
```

### Inner Classes
This style is similar to the second.  Instead of having our Comparator classes outside the scope of ComparatorTester, they are encapsulated inside the scope of the class.

``` java
public class ComparatorTester {

    class CountryComparatorByName_a {}
}
```

### Named Instances of Anonymous Inner Classes
This style is similar to the previous ( you see a pattern here? ).

``` java
public class ComparatorTester {

    public static void main( String[] args ) {
        List<Country> countries = ...;

        Comparator<Country> comp1 = new Comparator<Country>() {
            public int compare(Country country1, Country country2) {
                return country1.getName().compareTo(country2.getName());
            }
        }

	Collections.sort( countries, comp1 );
    }
}
```

### Anonymous Instances of Anonymous Inner Classes
Lastly,

``` java
public class ComparatorTester {

    public static void main( String[] args ) {
        List<Country> countries = ...;

        Collections.sort(countries, new Comparator<Country>() {
            public int compare(Country country1, Country country2) {
                return country1.getName().compareTo(country2.getName());
            }
        }
    }
}
``` 

## Java 8
Let's take a look at some of the features that Java 8 has to offer.

Java 8 introduced sorting to the [List](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/List.html#sort-java.util.Comparator) class.  Instead of using a static method, we can call sort directly on our
list, provided that we include a Comparator.

``` java
public class ComparatorTester {

    public static void main( String[] args ) {
        List<Country> countries = ...;

        countries.sort(new Comparator<Country>() {
            public int compare(Country country1, Country country2) {
                return country1.getName().compareTo(country2.getName());
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Next, lets look at lambda expressions.  We can convert our anonymous inner class into a lambda expression.  For more information on lambda expressions in Java, [please visit here](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/lambdaexpressions.html).  Comparator is a Functional Interface, which allows us to use lambda expressions with it.

``` java
public class ComparatorTester {

    public static void main( String[] args ) {
        List<Country> countries = ...;

	// Using a lambda expression which was the body of our compare() method from our anonymous inner class.
        countries.sort( (Country country1, Country country2) -> country1.getName().compareTo(country2.getName());

	// Lambdas use target typing, so they can infer the object type from the context in which it is being used.
        countries.sort( (c1, c2) -> c1.getName().compareTo(c2.getName());
    }
}
```

Now, we will look at the [Stream](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/package-summary.html) class.

``` java
public class ComparatorTester {

    public static void main( String[] args ) {
        List<Country> countries = ...;

	countries.stream()
            .sorted(Comparator.comparing( Country::getName ).thenComparing( Country::getArea )) // using Method References and Chaining
	    .forEach(System.out::println); // using Method Reference
    }
}
```

Instead of using Method References, you could use lambda expressions.  Because we have unique names for our Countries, the thenComparing() is pointless.


## Conclusion
In Scheme, we created mySort which took two parameters, a list and a function.  This function could be any comparator, and in turn, the comparator had a formal parameter which took another function.  This function was either < or >.  If we wanted to sort with <= or >=, then we would have needed to create a function to handle these cases.  Remember that the functions, < and >, are built-in functions in Scheme.

In Java, we used the Collections library to help us sort.  The Collections.sort() method is similar to our Scheme's mySort function.  Collections.sort() took two parameters, same as mySort, that was a
list and a Comparator object.  You experienced different programming "styles" in Java to solve our example of sorting names, areas, and populations of certain countries.  For us to sort descending, we 
had to use Collections.reverseOrder() and supply our comaparator as the actual parameter.  By doing so, we did not need to construct additional classes.  

As we progressed through the styles, we were able 
to leverage the features presented in Java 8, namely lambda expressions, streams, and List.sort().  Even though Java 8 was not apart of the original class discussion, I thought it 
was important to include it here.  It gave us the opportunity to compare the functional implementations.

In Java 8, we used lambda expressions and streams to implement generic sorting.  There were two ways of writing the lambda expression: formally and target typing.  With streams, you can envision a pipeline with each method linked together.  I highly recommend reviewing lambda expressions and streams in Java 8.
