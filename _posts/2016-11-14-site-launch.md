To help me understand new and existing Java Frameworks, I created this blog to document my journey.  In 2010, I went back to school to complete my Bachelors and Masters in Computer Science.  After I graduated with my Masters in Computer Science in the fall of 2015, I quickly realized that much of my experience was out of date - Servlets and JSP.  As I saught employment, most companies were looking for Spring/Hibernate or Full Stack Developers.  I had little experience with Javascript, and I had even less with Spring and Hibernate.
A few months ago I started tinkering with Spring Boot, and I instantly gravitated towards it.  It was a refreshingly, new experience to create MVC applications than I was accustomed to using Servlets and JSP.  One of the first projects I tried to convert was my group Software Engineering project from my Bachelors program.  

So, with this site, I am trying new frameworks and applications to spearhead my growth using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and Markdown to gather my thoughts and showcase my journey to the world.
