## Introduction
To help me understand new and existing Java Frameworks, I created this blog to document my journey.  In 2010, I went back to school to complete my Bachelors and Masters in Computer Science.  After I graduated with my Masters in Computer Science in the fall of 2015, I quickly realized that much of my experience was out of date - Servlets and JSP.  As I saught employment, most companies were looking for Spring/Hibernate or Full Stack Developers.  I had little experience with Javascript, and I had even less with Spring and Hibernate.

## Spring Framework
A few months ago I started tinkering with Spring Boot, and I instantly gravitated towards it.  It was a refreshingly, new experience to create MVC applications than I was accustomed to using Servlets and JSP.  One of the first projects I tried to convert was my group Software Engineering project from my Bachelors program.

### Quintessential Program for Any Language
[Spring Framework](http://www.spring.io) has a cornucopia of information regarding to Spring, and I highly recommend this valuable resource to any aspiring Software Engineer / Developer interested in Spring.  Their [Guides](http://spring.io/guides) provide enough information for you to grasp the basics and propel you to learn more.

"Hello World."  Two words that spark imagination for any developer learning a new language.  These two words was a gateway for learning many languages throughout my career.  And, like every language I learnt in the past, I created an introductory Spring Boot application for discovery and knowledge.  But, like many "Hello World" programs, you are eager to learn and experience more.  I quickly found myself seeking to expand my knowledge and discover more of what Spring had to offer.

## Conclusion
So, with this site, I am trying new frameworks and applications to spearhead my growth using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and Markdown to gather my thoughts and showcase my journey to the world.
